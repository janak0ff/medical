                                 <h2>Breast Cancer</h2>
                                 <p>Breast cancer is a type of cancer that occurs when the cells in the breast tissue
                                    grow abnormally and uncontrollably, forming a mass or lump called a tumor. These
                                    abnormal cells can invade surrounding tissues and spread to other parts of the body
                                    through the bloodstream or lymphatic system, a process known as metastasis.</p>
                                 <p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, although it can also
                                    occur in men. The exact cause of breast cancer is not fully understood, but it is
                                    believed to result from a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental
                                    factors.</p>
                                 <h3>Risk factors</h3>
                                 <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Age:</strong> The risk of breast cancer increases with age, and most
                                       cases are diagnosed in women over 50 years old.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Women are at a higher risk of developing breast cancer
                                       compared to men.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Family history:</strong> Having a close relative, such as a mother,
                                       sister, or daughter, who has had breast cancer increases the risk.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Genetic mutations:</strong> Certain inherited genetic mutations, such as
                                       BRCA1 and BRCA2, significantly increase the risk of breast cancer.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Hormone exposure:</strong> Exposure to estrogen, either through hormone
                                       replacement therapy or a longer lifetime exposure due to early menstruation or
                                       late menopause, can increase the risk.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Reproductive history:</strong> Having no children or having the first
                                       child after age 30 may slightly increase the risk of breast cancer.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Radiation exposure:</strong> Exposure to ionizing radiation, especially
                                       at a young age, increases the risk of breast cancer.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Lifestyle factors:</strong> Factors such as obesity, physical
                                       inactivity, alcohol consumption, and a diet high in fat can increase the risk of
                                       breast cancer.</li>
                                 </ul>
                                 <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                                 <p>Common symptoms of breast cancer include:</p>
                                 <ul>
                                    <li>A lump or thickening in the breast or underarm area</li>
                                    <li>Changes in the size, shape, or appearance of the breast</li>
                                    <li>Changes to the skin over the breast, such as dimpling or redness</li>
                                    <li>Nipple inversion or changes to the nipple, including discharge</li>
                                    <li>Swelling or pain in the breast</li>
                                 </ul>
                                 <p>It's important to note that these symptoms can also be caused by non-cancerous
                                    conditions. However, if you notice any of these changes or other unusual symptoms,
                                    it's important to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation.</p>
                                 <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
                                 <p>Diagnostic tests for breast cancer may include:</p>
                                 <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Clinical breast exam:</strong> A healthcare professional will examine
                                       the breasts and underarms for lumps or other changes.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Mammogram:</strong> This is an X-ray of the breast that can help detect
                                       breast cancer at an early stage, often before it can be felt.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Ultrasound:</strong> This imaging test uses sound waves to create images
                                       of the breast tissue, which can help distinguish between solid tumors and
                                       fluid-filled cysts.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):</strong> This imaging technique uses a
                                       powerful magnet and radio waves to create detailed images of the breast tissue.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Biopsy:</strong> A small sample of breast tissue is removed and examined
                                       under a microscope to determine if cancer cells are present.</li>
                                 </ul>
                                 <h3>Treatment</h3>
                                 <p>Treatment for breast cancer depends on the stage, type, and aggressiveness of the
                                    cancer, as well as the patient's overall health and preferences. Common treatment
                                    options include:</p>
                                 <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Surgery:</strong> This may involve removing the tumor (lumpectomy) or
                                       the entire breast (mastectomy), as well as nearby lymph nodes.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Radiation therapy:</strong> High-energy X-rays or other types of
                                       radiation are used to kill cancer cells in the breast and surrounding tissue.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Chemotherapy:</strong> These are drugs that kill rapidly dividing cells,
                                       including cancer cells. Chemotherapy can be given before surgery to shrink the
                                       tumor or after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Hormone therapy:</strong> For cancers that are hormone
                                       receptor-positive, hormone therapy can block the effects of estrogen or lower
                                       estrogen levels in the body, thereby slowing or stopping the growth of cancer
                                       cells.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Targeted therapy:</strong> These drugs target specific proteins or
                                       pathways involved in the growth and survival of cancer cells, such as
                                       HER2-positive breast cancers.</li>

                                       Breast cancer is the second most common form of cancer in Europe, with an
                                       estimated
                                       245,000 new cases each year. In women, it is the most common type of cancer. But
                                       it
                                       is not
                                       just women who get it—1 in every 150 patients who get it is a man.

                                       Breast cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in women.
                                       However,
                                       as a result of improved screening, extensive research and development of
                                       treatments,
                                       the
                                       outlook for patients has improved substantially in recent years.

                                       Each breast is made up of a glandular tissue, connective tissue and fat. The
                                       glandular
                                       tissue consists of lobules capable of producing milk after childbirth. A network
                                       of
                                       ducts
                                       carries the milk from the lobules to the nipple. Fat fills the spaces between the
                                       lobules
                                       and ducts and accounts for nearly 80 percent of the breast during the
                                       reproductive
                                       years.
                                       An area of breast tissue extends into the armpit (or axilla) called the axillary
                                       tail.

                                       <br><br>

                                       A network of vessels drain fluid called lymph from the breast mainly into lymph
                                       nodes in
                                       the armpit, but some lymph goes to lymph glands, behind the breastbone and behind
                                       the
                                       collarbone. These lymph vessels belong to a network of channels and lymph nodes
                                       known as
                                       the lymphatic system, which filters and returns lymph to the bloodstream and
                                       helps
                                       protect
                                       the body against infection.

                                       Within our bodies cells are constantly growing old, dying and being replaced by
                                       new
                                       cells.
                                       This renewal process is normally ordered and controlled. However, it can
                                       sometimes
                                       become
                                       uncontrolled, resulting in a mass known as a tumor or a neoplasm. Tumors may be
                                       benign or
                                       malignant. A benign tumor is not cancer—it does not invade into other tissues or
                                       spread
                                       around the body.

                                       <br><br>

                                       Malignant tumors are cancerous. They invade surrounding tissues and destroy them.
                                       Cells
                                       can also break off from the original tumor and travel through the lymphatic
                                       system
                                       and the
                                       bloodstream to other organs where they take hold and grow to produce secondary
                                       tumors.
                                       This spread of cancer is called metastasis. Some tumors are aggressive and spread
                                       early in
                                       their development whereas others become metastatic only in the later or advanced
                                       stages of
                                       the disease.

                                       There are several different forms of breast cancer. They are classified according
                                       to
                                       their
                                       appearance under the microscope and whether the cancer has spread. The two most
                                       common
                                       forms of breast cancer described by the pathologist are ductal carcinoma, which
                                       was
                                       originally thought to originate in the milk ducts, and lobular carcinoma, which
                                       was
                                       thought to originate in the lobules. In fact, it is now known that both ductal
                                       and
                                       lobular
                                       cancers develop in the lobule and the duct, which drains the lobule, which are
                                       known
                                       together as the terminal duct lobular unit. These two types of cancer behave
                                       differently.

                                       <br><br>

                                       If the cancer remains in its place of origin in the terminal duct or the lobule,
                                       it
                                       is
                                       described as in situ—which means ‘in place’. For example, a cancer consisting of
                                       ductal
                                       cells is known as ductal carcinoma in situ. Alternatively, if the cancer has
                                       spread
                                       to
                                       neighboring tissues, it is called invasive or infiltrating.

                                       Almost 80% of breast cancer cases are so-called cancers of ductal type. 5-10% are
                                       lobular
                                       and others are so-called special types that have particular features under the
                                       microscope,
                                       such as producing tubes or tubules in tubular cancer or producing mucous or mucin
                                       in
                                       mucinous carcinoma. There are special types of tumors like tubular and mucinous
                                       that
                                       tend
                                       to be less aggressive cancers and are less likely to spread. In carcinoma in situ
                                       of
                                       ductal or lobular type the cells remain within the lobules and draining ducts.

                                       Inflammatory breast cancer is an uncommon type of cancer and accounts for about
                                       one
                                       percent of breast tumors. Instead of forming a lump, the cancer cells grow along
                                       and
                                       block
                                       lymph vessels in the skin of the breast. This causes reddening and swelling of
                                       the
                                       breast.

                                       Paget’s disease of the breast involves an eczema-like rash which develops on the
                                       nipple
                                       and sometimes on the surrounding areola and is seen in 1% of women with breast
                                       cancer. The
                                       skin of the nipple and the areola may be ulcerated, inflamed and itchy with fluid
                                       discharge. About 90% of patients with Paget’s disease have underlying invasive or
                                       in
                                       situ
                                       breast cancer.

                                       Age is the biggest risk factor for breast cancer. Older females are at highest
                                       risk.
                                       Several other factors are also known to increase the risk in women. These include
                                       starting
                                       menstruation early in life, experiencing a late menopause, taking hormone
                                       replacement
                                       therapy or oral contraceptive treatment, having children late in life (when over
                                       30-years-old) or not bearing any children and an absence of breastfeeding. A
                                       family
                                       history of breast cancer is a risk factor of increased likelihood of the disease.
                                       Similarly, if a person has had breast cancer, there is a greater chance that they
                                       will
                                       develop another breast cancer. Diet also plays a role since obesity after
                                       menopause
                                       and a
                                       high intake of alcohol are both thought to increase risk.

                                       There may not be any symptoms in the early stages of breast cancer. Through
                                       screening the
                                       cancer can be discovered before symptoms develop. The most common sign is a lump
                                       in
                                       the
                                       breast. Other signs that may indicate breast cancer, particularly advanced cases,
                                       include
                                       a change in the size or shape of the breast or dimpling of the skin on the
                                       breast.
                                       Alternatively, the breast may be inflamed, sore and swollen. The nipple may also
                                       show
                                       changes, like fluid discharge, it may become inverted or pulled in, there may be
                                       a
                                       thickening or lump behind it or an eczema-like rash may develop on the nipple.

                                       Diagnosis involves an examination of the breasts and lymph glands and the
                                       surrounding
                                       areas. The doctor will also ask questions about your medical and family history.
                                       Several
                                       tests are available to help make a diagnosis. These include a mammogram, an x-ray
                                       of
                                       the
                                       breast that detects tumors that can or cannot be felt on physical examination.

                                       <br><br>

                                       Mammography helps to locate a tumor but is only of real value in older women
                                       (those
                                       over
                                       35-years-old.) Ultrasound can help tell whether a lump is solid, and if solid it
                                       is
                                       possibly cancerous. It can also tell whether it is filled with fluid and is a
                                       benign
                                       cyst.
                                       Fine needle or core biopsy is performed so that small quantities of breast cells
                                       are
                                       removed so they can be examined. A local anesthetic is used to numb the area
                                       first.
                                       Several biopsies are usually taken. The samples are then sent to the laboratory
                                       so
                                       that
                                       the cells and tissue can be assessed carefully under the microscope. Ultrasound
                                       or
                                       X-rays
                                       are used to guide the needle to the correct position. Rarely, a biopsy is
                                       performed,
                                       which
                                       is minor surgery—for example to remove the entire lump for examination.

                                       Routine blood tests and X-rays can also help detect cancer. The doctor may
                                       suggest a
                                       bone
                                       CT, MRI or PET scan to detect a patient’s general fitness and the spread of
                                       cancer
                                       to
                                       other parts of the body.

                                       Tumor tissue may also be examined for hormone and growth factor receptors. The
                                       hormones
                                       estrogen and progesterone enhance the growth of the tumor. Similarly, a tumor
                                       with
                                       high
                                       levels of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (known as HER2 positive)
                                       will
                                       grow
                                       more quickly than HER2-negative tumors. The receptor status of the tumor helps
                                       determine
                                       which treatments are most suitable.

                                       The tumor is staged from 0 to 4. The stage is determined by a TNM score. TNM
                                       refers
                                       to
                                       tumor, lymph node and metastasis. The original tumor is scored from 0 to 4
                                       depending
                                       on
                                       its size and spread. The lymph nodes are scored 0 to 3 depending on the extent of
                                       involvement and metastasis is scored as 0 if absent or 1 if present.

                                       In stage 0, the cells are contained within the ducts. Stage 1 cancers have a
                                       tumor
                                       smaller
                                       than 2 centimeters which has not spread. In stage 2, the tumor may be 2–5
                                       centimeters
                                       and/or the lymph nodes may be affected, but the cancer has not spread to other
                                       parts
                                       of
                                       the body. Stage 1 and 2 are known as early breast cancer. Stage 3 and 4 represent
                                       advanced
                                       breast cancer. In stage three, the tumor is over 5 centimeters and may be
                                       attached
                                       to
                                       surrounding muscle or skin. The lymph nodes are usually affected but there is no
                                       metastasis. In stage 4, the final stage, cancer spreads to other organs in the
                                       body.

                                       Treatment of breast cancer depends on many factors, including the type and stage
                                       of
                                       the
                                       cancer, its receptors and the age and menopausal status of the patient. For early
                                       disease,
                                       surgery to remove the cancer is the primary treatment, which may be followed by a
                                       course
                                       of radiotherapy. To reduce the risk of recurrence, chemotherapy and/or hormone
                                       therapy may
                                       also be used in stage 1 and 2 of the disease.

                                       Surgery may be an option for treating stage 3 cancers after initial treatment
                                       with
                                       chemotherapy or hormone therapy for reducing the size of the tumor. Radiation
                                       therapy is
                                       usually given following surgery to reduce the possibility of metastases.

                                       Lumpectomy involves the removal of the tumor along with a small amount of healthy
                                       tissue
                                       surrounding it, preserving a major portion of the breast—which is why it is known
                                       as
                                       breast-conserving surgery. Patients having a lumpectomy for invasive cancer would
                                       have
                                       their lymph nodes either removed or checked at the same time.

                                       <br><br>

                                       Mastectomy involves the removal of the whole breast, including the nipple and
                                       areola.
                                       Lumpectomy or mastectomy can be combined with removal of some of the axillary
                                       nodes
                                       (so-called sampling) or, if blue dye and radioactive material is used to find the
                                       nodes
                                       which drain the breast, sentinel lymph node biopsy. Alternatively, if the
                                       axillary
                                       nodes
                                       are thought or known to be affected, all the nodes are removed (which is known as
                                       axillary
                                       node clearance.) Radiotherapy may be advised after mastectomy, if necessary.
                                       Breast
                                       reconstructive surgery may be possible for some women undergoing mastectomy.

                                       Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays to destroy the cancer cells. It is most
                                       commonly
                                       used after lumpectomy and, if required, after mastectomy. It is rarely used in
                                       large
                                       or
                                       locally advanced cancers to reduce the tumor size before surgery, alongside
                                       medication.
                                       The therapy is usually given as a series of 10-minute daily sessions over 3 to 6
                                       weeks.

                                       Hormonal therapies are also given after surgery and radiotherapy or chemotherapy
                                       to
                                       reduce
                                       the risk of the cancer returning. These drugs are only effective if the cancer
                                       has
                                       the
                                       relevant hormone receptors. Tamoxifen is an anti-estrogen drug, which binds to
                                       receptors
                                       and prevents the hormone from being used by the tumor cells to grow. Aromatase
                                       inhibitors
                                       reduce estrogen levels by blocking its production in body tissues in
                                       post-menopausal
                                       women
                                       only. Examples include anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane.

                                       Stopping production of estrogen in the ovaries is possible using agonists of
                                       luteinising
                                       hormone releasing-hormone such as goserelin, which decrease the production of
                                       estrogen-stimulating hormones by the brain, so removing the stimulus for the
                                       ovaries
                                       to
                                       produce estrogen.

                                       Chemotherapy is the use of cytotoxic drugs that destroy cancer cells by
                                       interfering
                                       with
                                       how they grow and divide. There are many different types of chemotherapy drugs.
                                       They
                                       are
                                       often used in combination over a course of several months. Examples are
                                       doxorubicin,
                                       epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate, paclitaxel and
                                       docetaxel.

                                       HER2-positive tumors may also respond to treatment with the monoclonal antibody
                                       trastuzumab. It attaches to HER2 receptors on the cancer cells and reduces
                                       incoming
                                       growth
                                       signals.

                                       The earlier breast cancer is discovered, the better the outlook for treatment.
                                       You
                                       should
                                       report any changes in the shape or feel of your breasts to your doctor. A self
                                       breast exam
                                       should begin by looking at your breasts in a mirror with your hands on your hips.
                                       Look for
                                       any changes in the texture, size or shape. Inspect the breasts again with your
                                       arms
                                       raised
                                       overhead and your hands clasped together. Then feel each breast while lying down.
                                       Use a
                                       firm touch, keeping your fingers flat and together.
                                       <br><br>


                                       With the left arm raised above your head, use the right hand to examine the left
                                       breast.
                                       Move your hand in circles beginning at the nipple and radiating outward, to make
                                       sure that
                                       every part of the breast is examined, from your collarbone to the top of your
                                       abdomen, and
                                       from your armpit to between the breasts. Switch hands and examine the other
                                       breast
                                       in the
                                       same way. Finally, repeat the examination while standing up. Some people find it
                                       easiest
                                       to do this in the shower. Report any changes to your doctor.

                                       Regular screening tests are also advised. Mammography is advised every three
                                       years
                                       for
                                       women between the ages of 50 and 70.

                                       The causes of breast cancer are not fully understood but there are several steps
                                       you
                                       can
                                       take to limit the risk of developing breast cancer. For instance, limit your
                                       alcohol
                                       intake, lose any excess weight and exercise regularly. Eat a well-balanced diet
                                       with
                                       plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, and avoid exposure to pesticides. Finally,
                                       discuss
                                       the benefits and risks with your doctor before starting any hormone replacement
                                       or
                                       oral
                                       contraceptive therapy.
