               style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">eye</a> is a very complex sense
            organ which responds to changes in light and enables us to see. The ability to see depends on various
            structures in the eye. The outermost part of the eye is the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/eyelid"
               style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">eyelid</a>, which protects the
            eye and lubricates the eyeball. The outermost layer of the eye is the <a
               href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sclera"
               style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">sclera</a>, the white of the eye.
            Muscles connected to the sclera control eye movements. The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/cornea"
               style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">cornea</a> is transparent and
            covers the front of the eye. It is a powerful refracting surface where light rays are bent, refracted and
            focused. </font>

               style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">iris</a>. It controls light
            levels inside the eye. The pupil is the round opening in the center of the iris. <a

               sphincter muscles</a> of the iris change the pupil size according to the amount of light. The soft lens
            located behind the pupil allows the muscles to adjust its shape and focus. This allows us to focus on
            something close to us and far away. The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/retina"
               style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">retina</a> is a sensory tissue

               style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">Myopia</a>, or short sight, is
            the inability to see distant objects as clearly as near objects. With myopia, the cornea is too steep,
            causing images to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it. Persons with <a

            have more difficulty seeing near objects as clearly as distant objects. Hyperopia occurs when the cornea is

            preparation for surgery. Contact lens wearers need to discontinue and switch to glasses at least 2 weeks
            prior to surgery in the case of soft contact lenses, 3 weeks in case of rigid gas permeable lenses and 4
            weeks in the case of hard lens. Cosmetics should be avoided the day before surgery.</font>

               style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">anesthetic</a> drops are
            administered into the eyes. A suction ring is placed on the eye to stabilize and check the eye pressure. The

               style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">microkeratome</a>, a cutting
            instrument, is attached to the suction ring. A thin flap of the cornea is lifted and the inner tissue of the
            cornea is exposed. The exposed layer of the cornea is then reshaped with an <a
               href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excimer_laser"
               style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">excimer laser</a>. Each pulse
            removes a microscopic layer. The actual laser treatment typically lasts less than one minute. The flap is
            folded back over the eye and the cornea heals naturally without the need for stitches.</font>

         <font size="4">To treat nearsightedness, the laser removes tissue from the center of the cornea, thereby making
            it flatter. In the case of farsightedness, the central part of the cornea is made steeper. This is done by
            directing the laser beam to remove tissue from around this area. To treat astigmatism, the cornea is made
            more spherical. This is done by removing tissue in one direction more than the other by changing the pattern
            of the beam.</font>

         <font size="4">Surgery usually takes less than 5 minutes for each eye. Patients often experience a blurring of
            vision immediately after the surgery. Patients are given eye shields to protect the eye from touching or
            rubbing. Eye drops are administered to prevent eye infections. Vision improves and continues to clear. Pain
            is rare and mild, and goes away in a few hours. Patients may experience dry eyes, sensitivity to light, and
            glare and halos, which normally subside as the eyes heal. Artificial tears are used to lubricate the eye.
            The patient should avoid contact sports and swimming for a couple of days. The patient is also advised to
            avoid any lotions or creams near the eyes for two weeks following surgery. Strenuous work should be avoided
            the four weeks following surgery. Eyes are examined and tested within the next two days. </font>

         <font size="4">While good vision is possible, expectations of perfection may be unrealistic. Some people
            require glasses for fine tuning vision for conditions such as night driving, computer work and heavy
            reading. Complications of surgery, though rare, may occur in less than 1% of the patients. Overcorrection or
            undercorrections can happen occasionally. In this case the patient is prescribed contact lenses or glasses.
            The flap could develop wrinkles, which may need repositioning. Some patients develop problems in night
            vision such as glare or halo. Permanent dry eye is another complication, which can be treated with
            artificial tears. In rare cases repeat surgery may be done after 3 months by raising the same flap. </font>

               style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">Cataract</a> is clouding of the
            lens of the eye due to the deposition of proteins, which obstructs the passage of light. It can result in a
            partial or severe decrease in vision. Cataract is a significant cause of low vision or blindness. Age
            related cataract is responsible for 48% of blindness in the world, which is nearly 18 million people. The

            associated with aging and is the most common type of cataract. Nuclear cataracts develop in the center of
            the lens. Cortical cataract develops in the lens cortex, and gradually spreads its wedge shaped spokes
            towards the center of the lens. This is more common among people with diabetes. It may impair both distance
            and near vision and may require surgery at early stages. Subcapsular cataract develops at the back of the
