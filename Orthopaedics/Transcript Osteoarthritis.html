               href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage">cartilage</a>, which is elastic and flexible. Cartilage
            layers contain no nerves or blood vessels. Thus injury to the cartilage does not heal quickly. The main
            function of the cartilage is to cover the surface of joint bones, allowing smooth movement of joints and
            preventing the bones from wear and tear. It also acts as a shock absorber, preventing the bones from injury
            during movement or impact.&nbsp; The muscles attached to the joints also act as shock absorbers and help in
            keeping the bones together, as well as generating the force needed to move the joints.</font>

            which secretes a clear, sticky fluid known as the synovial fluid into the space. The synovial fluid along

         <font size="4">Osteoarthritis is a disease that is characterized by focal, discrete areas of degradation of the
            cartilage surfaces of the joints. The cells of the cartilage, the <a
               href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrocytes">chondrocytes</a>, secrete the proteins, principally
            collagen, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteoglycans">proteoglycans</a> that make up the
            structure of the cartilage.&nbsp; Like all other tissues in the body, these substances are undergoing
            constant turnover, and the cells can secrete enzymes that break down old areas of cartilage as well as
            secrete the chemicals that form the new structure or matrix. &nbsp;In normal, functional joints, these
            degenerative and regenerative enzymes are well balanced, allowing the cartilage to maintain its structure
            and function efficiently.</font>

         <font size="4">In</font>
         <font size="4"> osteoarthritis the normal balance of slow degradation and regeneration of the cartilage is
            disrupted, in favor of tissue breakdown. Over time this can lead to fissures or cracks appearing in the
            cartilage and so much loss of substance that the bone underneath is exposed. In addition there is a mild,
            variable degree of inflammation in the synovial lining of the joint, and a thickening of the capsule.&nbsp;
            But the slow process of developing osteoarthritis, which centers on those parts of the joint under most
            mechanical stress, is not confined to the cartilage.&nbsp; From the beginning the bone and other tissues are
            also affected.&nbsp; The ability of cartilage to repair is small. But bone is a very active, reparative
            tissue. The activity of the bone below areas of damaged cartilage increases greatly, the shape of the joint
            changes, and bone outgrowths appear at the margins of the joint&ndash; these are called <a

         <font size="4">These reactions of the bone and soft tissues can be seen as an attempt by the joint to repair
            itself. The joint tries to repair itself and contain any abnormal mechanical stresses by splinting itself
            and changing its shape. At this stage, in some people, the disease may stabilize and although one may be
            left with a damaged joint, the disease stops progressing and the symptoms can improve.</font>

            experience any symptoms. The symptoms, if they do occur, include pain (particularly on use of the affected
            joint), discomfort, stiffness or swelling of the joint. One characteristic feature is the short-lasting but
            severe gelling of joints that occurs after resting them in one position; people with osteoarthritis find it
            difficult to get moving after inactivity and have to work their joints in as they start a new activity. Bony
            lumps in the edges of the joint may be tender and loss of flexibility can also occur. The joint may become
            larger and deformed. Back pain or neck pain can accompany osteoarthritis of the neck and spine joints. In
            people with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip joints pain while standing, walking and climbing stairs may

            of several factors like being overweight, aging, joint injury, having over used or deformed joints or
            heredity. Previously damaged joints are most likely to be affected, such as from an injury or from
            repetitive mechanical stress to the knees, hips, fingers, thumb base and lower spine. Diseases such as <a

               href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopic_lavage">lavage</a> are generally not recommended for
            cleaning the knee in osteoarthritis, a small number of people, particularly those with structural damage to
            the joint (as seen on imaging), may benefit from this procedure. A local anesthetic is administered through
            a small incision and a thin tube, that has a light and a camera and other devices attached to its end. The
            joint is then seen on a TV screen. During lavage, <a
               href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_%28medicine%29">saline</a> is flushed into the joint and the
            collected blood, fluid or pieces of tissue are flushed out. In debridement however, loose fragments of bone
            or cartilage that are still adhering to the bone surface are scraped out. These procedures can provide
            temporary relief from pain and inflammation.</font>

         <font size="4">Research has shown that osteoarthritis can be prevented. Precautions taken early in life can
            help avoid the excessive wear and tear of weight-bearing joints. Some of the preventitive measures include
            losing excess weight, wearing comfortable and supportive footwear, maintaining correct posture and regular
            exercise.</font>
