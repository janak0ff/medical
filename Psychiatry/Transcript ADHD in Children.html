               disorder</a> or ADHD is a childhood behavioral and developmental disorder that often persists into
            adolescence and adulthood. Millions of school age children, at least 1 out of every 20, suffer from this
            disorder. These children are also at increased risk for school difficulties, problems with friends, and
            conflicts at home. Over their lifetime, many of these children also suffer greater problems with substance

            brain's frontal lobes help us evaluate choices before making a decision. The striatum converts impulsive
            thoughts into actions. The cerebellum is involved in the coordination of complex activities. These areas of
            the brain are linked by neurons or brain cells that form a circuit and communicate through neurochemical

         <font size="4">Heredity is the most common risk factor for ADHD. The heritability of ADHD is in the range of
            80%, making the condition almost as inheritable as height. There is about a 35% chance that any child with
            ADHD will have at least one ADHD adult. Fetal exposure to toxic substances during pregnancy, for example a
            mother who smoked and consumed alcohol during pregnancy; or childhood exposure to lead have been associated
            with increased risk for developing ADHD. Premature babies born less than 32 weeks gestation or with a birth
            weight of less than 1400 grams also demonstrate increased risk for ADHD. ADHD is not due to a child's having
            low intelligence or being lazy, nor is it due to external factors such as poor parenting, excessive
            television viewing or diet.</font>

         <font size="4">ADHD is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity that are particularly severe
            when compared with most individuals of the same age. Children with ADHD exhibit six or more symptoms of
            either inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity as defined by the fourth edition of the <a
               href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders"
               style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
               of Mental Disorders</a>, or DSM-IV. These symptoms generally cause difficulties in multiple settings such
            as home, school, or with friends. Hyperactive/impulsive symptoms are generally detected prior to the
            beginning of school. Inattentive symptoms are often not evident until age 8 or 9, or even later in some
            cases.</font>

      <span style="line-height: 150%; font-family: Arial">
         <font size="4">The inattentive type of ADHD is typified by children who have difficulty paying attention to
            small details and who often rush through their work and make careless mistakes in school. For example, they
            might lose points on tests because they fail to read directions properly or do not complete both sides of a
            handout. They also might have difficulty listening when spoken to directly and might not follow through on
            instructions, particularly with complicated tasks. They often have difficulty organizing tasks and
            activities and avoid work that requires long periods of mental effort. They might frequently lose toys,
            books and other belongings. They can be easily distracted by extraneous stimuli and often forget routine
            tasks. Parents often become frustrated when homework takes much more time to complete than expected.</font>

         <font size="4">Children with the hyperactive/impulsive subtype of ADHD often fidget and squirm in a way that is
            annoying to others. They are frequently restless, particularly when bored or unchallenged. This may manifest
            in the form of finger drumming or shaking legs. They are frequently unable to remain seated for long and may
            indulge in excessive running and climbing. They have difficulty in playing quietly and tend to talk
            excessively. These children may blurt out answers before questions are completed and have difficulty
            standing in line or waiting their turn. They are prone to interrupt and intrude on others even when they are
            busy, such as when parents are speaking with someone else on the telephone. On the playground, they might
            engage in risky or unsafe behaviors.</font>

         <font size="4">Children who exhibit both inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms are characterized as
            having the combined ADHD subtype. Manifestations of the disorder usually appear in varying degrees at home,
            in school, at work, and in social situations. Symptoms usually get worse in situations demanding sustained
            attention, such as classrooms.</font>

         <font size="4">Children with ADHD often display academic underachievement, regardless of their intelligence.
            Without treatment, these children are at increased risk for developing low self-esteem around school issues.
            These children are often rejected or receive negative attention for their behaviors, and consequently
            develop feelings of inadequacy and failure. Similarly, children with ADHD often have difficulties sustaining
            friendships and developing skills necessary for getting along well with others. This creates additional
            pitfalls in which ADHD children are more likely to become involved with delinquent behavior or conduct
            disordered activities, as well as problems with using tobacco, alcohol, and other forms of drug abuse.

         <font size="4">ADHD is generally diagnosed by Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists, Child Neurologists,
            Pediatricians, and Clinical Psychologists. The child should show symptoms persistently over the previous six
            months and the behavior should be more severe than children of the same age. These behaviors should be
            exhibited in more than two settings such as at school, home, day care or in social interactions. The
            behavior should impair the child's ability to make friends, to progress at school or to get along with

         <font size="4">Clinicians generally meet with parents and child to get an overview of the problem and assess
            developmental, medical, and social history. It is likely that parents and teachers will be asked to complete
            several behavioral rating scales to help the clinician assess the child's behavior over multiple settings.
            Tests of intelligence and learning achievement might be performed if there are concerns about other
            potential learning issues. It is usually assumed that the child has had normal pediatric care, and that
            general medical conditions, such as vision or hearing problems, have been ruled out as the likely cause of
            symptoms.</font>

         <font size="4">Medication is the only treatment that has been shown to be effective in reducing the core
            symptoms of ADHD. In most cases, a clinician will recommend medication as part of a comprehensive approach
            to helping patients and their families address the disorder. Psychosocial treatments such as parent
            management training, behavioral charts, social skills training, and accommodations at school might also be
            helpful and will be discussed with the family after careful consideration of an individual patient's needs.
            Parents of children with mild ADHD-related difficulties might chose to delay initiation of medication
            therapy. This is a reasonable option to discuss with the treating physician, but a trial of ADHD medication
            is usually warranted if the child is suffering from observable impairments.</font>

         <font size="4">Medications for ADHD are effective in controlling symptoms in the great majority of patients.
            The most commonly used types of medications for ADHD are classified as stimulants. These medications
            increase the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain. Some commonly used stimulants are <a
               href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylphenidate"
               style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">methylphenidate</a>, <a

               style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">amphetamine</a> salts. The common
            side effects of stimulants are decreased appetite, headache, stomachache, irritability and insomnia,
            although many of these 'side-effects' occur in ADHD children whether or not they are receiving medication.

            Set a routine for the child that includes a regular mealtime, studies, watching TV, playing, bedtime and
