            benign disease, its symptoms can significantly impact the quality of life of the patient and his spouse.
            Sleep deprivation, interference with outdoor activities like sports or travel and lack of satisfaction from
            sexual relationships impact the mental and emotional health of the patient. Further, the reduction in the

            nearly 90% of men >70 years of age. BPH is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland. It is normal
            for the prostate gland to keep growing throughout a man's life. It grows from the size of a pea, around
            puberty, to the size of a walnut or larger later in life. However, this enlargement may cause symptoms only
            later in life, usually after age 40. Nearly 30% of men may only suffer mild symptoms that will spontaneously
            stop after some time. However, for others the symptoms of BPH may severely affect their quality of life.

         <font size="4">The prostate gland is found in the male body. It helps in the process of reproduction. It is
            located beneath the urinary bladder, where urine is stored, and in front of the <a
               href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectum">rectum</a>, the end of the <a
               href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestive_tract">digestive tract</a>. The urethra is a tube that
            emerges from the bladder, passes through the prostate gland and carries the urine and sperm outside the male
            body. The main function of the prostate gland is to secrete a fluid, which helps provide transport medium
            and nutrition to sperms as they move through the urethra during sexual climax.</font>

      <span style="line-height: 150%; font-family: Arial">
         <font size="4">The symptoms of BPH occur due to an abnormal enlargement of the prostate gland. The urinary
            bladder usually contracts when it is filled to its maximum capacity with urine and propels the urine through
            the urethra to the outside. In a person with BPH, as the prostate gland expands, it compresses the urethra
            that passes through it. This obstructs the outlet to the bladder, making it more difficult to pass urine
            being retained in the bladder and can be associated with an increased irritability of the bladder walls.
            With time, the irritated bladder starts contracting even when small volumes of urine are present in it.
            Thus, the person experiences an increased frequency to urinate.</font>

            patient may be referred to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urologist">urologist</a>. The urologist
            will perform tests to confirm BPH. In the Digital Rectal Exam, the doctor will insert a gloved finger into
            the rectum and try to feel the prostate gland lying in front of it. This test will give a general idea about
            the size of the prostate gland. He may elect to carry out a blood test called <a

            doctor will insert a probe or a tube into the rectum. This probe will emit sound waves that hit against the
            prostate, the resulting echo draws an image of the prostate gland that is displayed on a television screen.
