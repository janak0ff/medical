            and the joints. It is an uncomfortable chronic cutaneous disease that affects the ability to function.
            Psoriatics often suffer from psychological and emotional distress because the disease impacts their physical
            appearance. Psoriasis affects 2-3 percent of the world's population. Its onset usually occurs after puberty.

            layer of the skin that consists of several layers of cells arranged on top of one another. New layers of
            cells continue to develop from the bottom of the epidermis and rise to the top in a process called turnover.
            In a continuous cycle, skin cells slough off and are replaced by newer layers. Normally this cycle takes
            about 3-4 weeks. This layer provides a tough, flexible and waterproof covering for the body.</font>

         <font size="4">The Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) is the most widely used measurement tool for psoriasis.
            PASI combines the assessment of the severity of lesions and the area affected into a single score in the
            range 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). The PASI can be too unwieldy to use outside of trials, which
            has led to attempts to simplify the index for clinical use.</font>

         <font size="4">Treatment for psoriasis depends on the type, location and severity. Topical treatments are the
            first line treatment for mild disease. A variety of topical creams can be directly applied to the skin to
            ameliorate psoriasis.</font>

            irritate skin and even stain skin, hair and clothing. It is applied and then washed off after a short while.
            One of the advantages of anthralin over cortisone ointments is that once the psoriasis is under control, it
            does not recur for a long time. Taclonex, which is a combination of dovonex and <a
