         <font size="4">Depression is a leading cause of disability affecting millions of people worldwide. According to
            the World Health Organization, nearly 121 million people in the world suffer from depression. Depression
            occurs in men and women of all ages and backgrounds. However, it is more common in women than in men.
            Overall prevalence for depression is 17%. 43% of sufferers of depression fail to seek treatment for their
            symptoms. Of those diagnosed, two thirds were not prescribed medications for their symptoms.</font>

            lasting at least 2 weeks. Depression interferes with daily life, and can last for months or years. Those who
            suffer from depression experience a range of symptoms such as sadness, lack of interest, guilt, disturbances
            in sleep, loss of appetite, weight loss, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retardation"

         <font size="4">Depression is a result of chemical imbalances in the brain. Neurons or brain cells conduct and
            transmit electrical signals. Several millions of neurons are arranged end-to-end to form circuits in the
            brain. These circuits control all types of activities of the body such as seeing, hearing, eating and
            walking. These circuits also control our thoughts and emotions. The area where two neurons join together is
            called a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse"
               style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">synapse</a>. Electrical impulses
            generated within the neuronal cells jump across the synapse with the help of chemicals known as <a

         <font size="4">These neurotransmitters allow the electrical impulses to jump from one neuron to another and

         <font size="4">The drugs used for treating depression are called antidepressants. Different types of
            antidepressants are available. Almost all antidepressants work by increasing the levels of neurotransmitters

         <font size="4">It is important for the patient to visit a doctor regularly to monitor progress and to discuss
            the side effects of medications. Take medication as instructed by the doctor. A person with depression
            should try to socialize and be involved in daily activities, as well being part of a caring atmosphere.
            Patients should ignore the possible stigma that might discourage them from seeking help. They should also
            maintain a healthy lifestyle ' including exercise and a healthy diet. Physical activity and exercise has
            been found to help patients cope better. Walking is a good form of exercise. Avoid drugs and alcohol abuse
            as these may have adverse effects.</font>
