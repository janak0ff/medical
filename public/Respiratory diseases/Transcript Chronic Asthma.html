            situated on either side of the chest. Each lung consists of two branches called <a

               style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">bronchi</a>, which divide into

      <span style="line-height: 150%; font-family: Arial">
         <font size="4">When we breathe in, air passes into the lungs, ultimately reaching the alveoli. Here, the blood
            absorbs oxygen from the inhaled air and releases carbon dioxide back into the alveoli to be breathed out. If
            inhaled foreign particles reach the lungs, the body sends immune cells to attack them, and produces mucus in
            the local area to protect the walls of the airways.</font>

         <font size="4">The airways of asthmatic individuals are chronically inflamed, which means they are typically
            irritated and swollen. They are also extra sensitive or hyper-responsive, so they react more easily and
            strongly to inhaled foreign particles. During an asthma attack, the airways become very narrow, the muscles
            around the airways tighten and too much mucus is produced, obstructing air movement. Because it is harder
            for air to pass through the narrow airways, symptoms of shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing and
            tightness in the chest develop. Itching on the chest or neck may be an early symptom, especially in

            Diagnosis is usually made by assessing the symptoms ' cough, shortness of breath, chest tightness and, the

            airway obstruction by measuring how fast you can breathe air out of your lungs. The flow rate will be lower

         <font size="4">Management of asthma follows a stepped approach and uses two types of treatment: those that
            relieve symptoms during an attack and those that control asthma over the long term. Patients are allocated a
            step according to their disease severity. In the first step, inhaled short-acting inhaled <a
               href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta2-adrenergic_agonist"
               style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">beta-2-agonists</a>
            are used to relieve symptoms. Examples include <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/salbutamol"
               style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">salbutamol</a> and <a
               href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/terbutaline"
               style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">terbutaline</a>. The patient
            takes the medication only when an attack occurs. The drugs quickly expand or dilate the airways. The effect
            is short-lasting and wears off after an attack. Symptom relief may be the only intervention required in mild
            intermittent asthma. If symptom relief alone is not sufficient, disease-controlling drugs may also be
            prescribed. These drugs correct the underlying airway problems in asthma and therefore help to prevent
            attacks. The first controller drug to be used is usually an inhaled steroid such as <a
               href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/fluticasone"
               style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">fluticasone</a> or <a

      <span style="line-height: 150%; font-family: Arial">
         <font size="4">The next step, if required, is to add an inhaled long-acting beta-2-agonist (such as <a

               style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">dry powder inhaler</a> is similar
            to a MDI, but is breath activated. The dry powder medication comes as a capsule or disk or may be stored in
            a compartment in the inhaler. Different types of dry powder inhalers or DPIs are available depending on the
            medication prescribed. Examples include Accuhaler, Aerolizer, Rotahaler and Turbohaler. Accuhalers contain
            several doses of the medication in powder form. To use this device, push the thumb grip away until a click
            is heard. Slide the lever away until it clicks. Seal the mouthpiece with the lips. Breathe in steadily and
            deeply. Remove the Accuhaler and hold your breath as long as possible. Exhale slowly. Push the thumb grip
            towards you and close the device. </font>

         <font size="4">An Aerolizer uses medication in capsule form. To use, pull the cap. Twist the mouthpiece to
            expose the capsule chamber. Take one blistered capsule and place it in the chamber in the base. Now close
            the mouthpiece by twisting. Holding the Aerolizer erect, press the two buttons on the base once. A click
            indicates that the capsule is pierced. Release the buttons and close the mouthpiece with your lips ensuring
            that the two buttons are on the sides. Inhale deeply. The capsule spins in the chamber and disperses the
            medicine. </font>

         <font size="4">A Rotahaler uses a capsule called a Rotocap. Hold the Rotahaler erect and insert the Rotocap
            into the opening with the transparent end first. The top of the capsule should be level with the opening.
            Twist the base of the Rotahaler to split the capsule. Inhale deeply and breathe out slowly. A rattling sound
            is heard as the capsule moves. Open the inhaler to remove the used capsule. The Rotahaler is generally used
            to deliver salbutamol. </font>

         <font size="4">A Turbohaler is a multi-dose inhaler. It has an indicator, which shows the number of doses left.
            In some Turbohalers a red indicator appears when there are twenty doses left. Holding the Turbohaler
            upright, remove the cap and twist the colored grip as far as possible and then bring it back. A click is
            heard when it is ready. Inhale deeply. Remove the inhaler and then exhale. Replace the cap after use.</font>

               style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">Nebulisers</a> are used to
            administer high doses of medication directly into the lungs since regular inhalers may be insufficient. The
            nebuliser converts the asthma drug from a solution into a fine spray from the mouthpiece or facemask to be
            inhaled. The medication can be inhaled by regular breathing over 5 to 10 minutes</font>

         <font size="4">It is important to learn about your disease and its treatment including how to use and look
            after your inhaler. Visit your doctor regularly to review your care plan. You should also learn how to
            recognize lack of asthma control from symptoms or peak flow measurements, and to know when to seek emergency
            care. Identifying and avoiding the factors that trigger your attacks is key. For example, exposure to house
            dust mites can be minimized by using protective mattress covers, removing or heavily vacuuming carpets and
            applying anti-mite chemicals to soft furnishings, particularly where you sleep. </font>

         <font size="4">Similarly, preventing further exposure to the sensitizing substance is critical in occupational
            asthma. All patients should avoid smoking and second-hand smoking. Parents of asthmatic children should stop
            smoking. If you are obese, it helps if you can lose some weight. Although you cannot cure asthma, you can
            control it by following these simple measures as well as taking your prescribed medications.</font>
